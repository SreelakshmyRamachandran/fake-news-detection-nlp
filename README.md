# fake-news-detection-nlp

# Overview

**Fake News Detection Using NLP** is a project that employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as either genuine or fake. Leveraging machine learning with a Decision Tree Classifier, the project aims to contribute to the identification and prevention of misinformation.

### Key Features

- **NLP-Powered Classification:** Utilizes advanced NLP techniques for accurate classification.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Implements a Decision Tree Classifier for news article classification.
- **Model Serialization:** Saves and loads the trained model using the `pickle` module.

### Motivation

The project is motivated by the growing challenge of misinformation in the digital age. By developing a tool to automatically detect fake news, we aim to promote media literacy and combat the spread of false information.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
